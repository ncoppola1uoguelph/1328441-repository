  <p>WA1:<br>One software that I personally used and thought was designed well was the python IDE PyCharm. PyCharm is a very useful application that I used throughout highschool in my computer science courses, and it helped me a lot in writing programs in python. The interface is very intuitive and easy to use, while also helping with debugging. Specifically, finding my files was never a problem, because it displayed them all in an organised list for easy access. The colours in the actual code helped me look at my own code and figure out where problems could occur, and the live warnings helped me keep my code clean and free of bugs. Overall, PyCharm is designed well for beginners like me to learn coding in an environment that is both practical and easy on the eyes. Software design is important because it directly influences how effectively users can interact with the software. Good software design enhances the overall user experience to make it accessible to people of all skill levels. Well designed software will provide a smooth experience where the user can easily navigate the application. This is important because the experience a user has with software will decide if they want to continue using it. This is why well designed software is versatile and appeals to different users with different requirements. Ultimately, thoughtful software design is essential for creating tools that meet functional requirements and also provide a positive and productive user experience.

  <p>WA2:<br>1.<br>During the requirements gathering stage, developers of a system use various methods to begin a rudimentary list of requirements. Methods can include interviewing clients or users, conducting surveys, observing interactions with their system and more. This part of the gathering is important because it lets the developers get an idea of their client’s needs. Afterwards, the developers assign requirements unique identification, and write their descriptions in simple language using the format: “The user/system must/should do one thing”. This is important because it makes the requirements easy to reference with their ID’s, and using the format in simple language makes each requirement easy for developers to understand and follow. Requirements are also assigned a priority and dependencies so the developers know which ones to work on first, and are organised in a table in a document. After completion, requirements are presented to inspectors for feedback. The requirements are made easily changeable because the process revises them several times. The process is important to the entire software development process because it helps developers understand the needs of their clients so they can make an efficient and intuitive system.<br>2.<br>As a programmer, I want my files to be accessible from the main page of the system so that I can easily access my programs<br>As a programmer, I want any syntax errors in my code to be underlined so that I can find them easily<br>As a programmer, I want to be able to make my program output in a separate window so that I can write code and see the output on separate monitors<br>As a programmer, I want to see brackets highlighted when my mouse is on them so that I can easily see each pair and not get confused<br>As a programmer, I want my lines to be numbered so that I can easily reference parts of my code and find errors

  <p>WA4:<br>Communication in software design is very important. Without communication, the final product can be vastly different from what the clients and target audience expected. Good communication between developers and stakeholders leads to a product that provides a well designed experience. During the development process, clear communication can prevent misunderstandings, reduce errors, and create a collaborative environment where developers and stakeholders can exchange ideas freely. Some key elements of effective communication include having regular updates between stakeholders and the development team to make sure the project stays on track; clear, concise requirements to make sure the developers don’t stray too far from what the stakeholders want; and active listening from both developers and stakeholders to make sure both parties are able to give input into the final product. An experience I’ve had where communication was an issue was at my old workplace, A&W. Our team usually communicated very well, but one time the person who was directing the kitchen gave a series of long requests to the employee working on the fryer. It was in the middle of a lunch rush, so the restaurant was busy and loud. The employee working the fryer didn’t hear everything, and because of this our team got very behind on orders. Using what I’ve learned in class, this could’ve been avoided if the kitchen director had given more concise requests one at a time so the fryer worker could understand better. Also, the kitchen director could’ve raised their voice so the fryer worker could listen better. The fryer worker could’ve helped to avoid this situation by asking the director to repeat themselves.
